                    <h3>Cricket</h3>
                  </a>
                  <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the
                    centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
                    balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler,
                    "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an
                    "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at
                    each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to
                    strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls the
                    ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends of the
                    pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each
                    batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include
                    being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side
                    either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
                    batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have
                    been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that
                    scored more runs wins, provided that the other team has completed its one or two scheduled innings.
                    The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international
                    matches.</p>

                    <h3>VolleyBall</h3>
                  </a>
                  <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team
                    tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has
                    been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball
                    was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer
                    Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

                    The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one
                    of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with
                    a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the
                    receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
                    The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but
                    individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches
                    are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in
                    such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus,
                    losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the
                    next rally. A few of the most common faults include:

                  <p>causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing
                    over the net;
                    catching and throwing the ball;
                    double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
                    four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
                    net foul: touching the net during play;
                    foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a front row
                    player is trying to keep the ball in play.</p>
                  The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short
                  contact) the ball with any part of the body.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one
                    another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
                    (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46
                    cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while
                    preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
                    unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops
                    and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point
                    free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play
                    expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

                    Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a
                    teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots –
                    the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept
                    passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that
                    bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling
                    the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.

                    The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the
                    center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile
                    player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting
                    guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of
                    offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three,
                    two-on-two, and one-on-one.</p>

                    <h3>Table Tennis</h3>
                  </a>
                  <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit
                    a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small
                    solid rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve,
                    the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on
                    their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A
                    point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands
                    quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving
                    the hitter a great advantage. The name "ping-pong" was in wide use before British manufacturer J.
                    Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name "ping-pong" then came to describe the game played
                    using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A
                    similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the "ping-pong" name
                    to Parker Brothers.

                    The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British enthusiast of table tennis, who discovered
                    novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This
                    was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet
                    of pimpled, or stippled, rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was growing in popularity by 1901
                    to the extent that tournaments were being organized, books being written on the subject, and an
                    unofficial world championship was held in 1902. In those early days, the scoring system was the same
                    as in lawn tennis.</p>

                    <h3>Boxing</h3>
                  </a>
                  <p>Boxing (also known as "Western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people,
                    usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards,
                    throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.

                    Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to "western boxing", in which only the fists are
                    involved, boxing has developed in various ways in different geographical areas and cultures. In
                    global terms, boxing is a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each
                    other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks,
                    elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of the forms of the modern
                    sport are western boxing, bare knuckle boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and
                    sanda. Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and
                    other combat sports.

                    While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest
                    evidence of any type of boxing can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the 3rd and 2nd millennia
                    BC. The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was
                    established as an Olympic game in 688 BC. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights,
                    largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867
                    introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.

                    Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most
                    international games — it also has its own world championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over
                    a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called "rounds".

                    A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent
                    incapable of continuing, disqualifies of an opponent, or the resignation of an opponent. When the
                    fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards
                    determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a professional bout
                    is considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest
